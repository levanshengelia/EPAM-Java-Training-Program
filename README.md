# EPAM-Java-Training-Program
Java Development (Powered by MJC School)

This repository contains the source code and exercises for the Java course I took on the EPAM website. 
The course covers the subjects of the Java programming language, including object-oriented programming concepts, data structures, control structures, etc.

Each module of the course includes several exercises and challenges, along with solutions for each task. The code is organized into separate directories for each module, and the solutions are provided in separate files. 

I hope that this repository will be a helpful resource for anyone learning Java, whether you are taking the EPAM course or studying on your own. Feel free to use the code and exercises in this repository as a learning tool, and please let me know if you have any feedback or suggestions!
